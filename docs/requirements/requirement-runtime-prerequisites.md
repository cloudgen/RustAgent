## 1. Purpose

What must be present before RustAgent can run, and what it refuses to install for you.

### 1.1 Human-facing

**In one sentence:** Cargo builds RustAgent. The logger is in-tree `StatusLog`. `setup` needs curl when it downloads grok. The program does not install packages as root.

| You | Another role | Not this |
|-----|--------------|----------|
| Have rustc, cargo, and the crossterm build | curl, scp, ssh, and crontab when you use those verbs | ChronicleLogger, pip, an automatic `sudo apt`, or Termux `pkg` from this package |

## 2. Core Rules

1. The binary **MUST NOT** depend on ChronicleLogger or pip. `StatusLog` in `src/logger.rs` is the logger.
2. `setup` **MUST** require `curl` on PATH when it downloads, unless a test runner supplies the bytes.
3. `sync-auth-from-remote` **MUST** require `scp`. `sync-auth-to-remote` **MUST** require `scp` and `ssh`. Tests may set `RUSTAGENT_SCP` and `RUSTAGENT_SSH`. `GROK_CLI_SCP` and `GROK_CLI_SSH` are secondary peer-tool overrides, not product names.
4. `add-crontab` **MUST** require a crontab program. Tests may set `RUSTAGENT_CRONTAB`. `GROK_CLI_CRONTAB` is a secondary override.
5. The package **MUST NOT** run `sudo` to install itself, **MUST NOT** run `apt`, and **MUST NOT** run Termux `pkg` by itself. Backup may use sudo only after the backup grant.
6. No FFmpeg prerequisite. This product does not join media.

## 3. Acceptance

| AC | Statement |
|----|-----------|
| AC-1 | `Cargo.toml` does not name ChronicleLogger or pip |
| AC-2 | setup source does not execute `install.sh` |
